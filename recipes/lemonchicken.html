    <h2>Parmesan Lemon Chicken and Rice Skillet</h2>

    <p>This one-pan chicken and rice meal is an easy weeknight dinner delight! Juicy chicken thighs are cooked with fresh lemon, creamy rice, and rich Parmesan cheese for a zesty and cheesy skillet recipe your family will love.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sweet Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Lemons</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Parsely</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Set a large sauté pan (with a lid) over medium heat, and add the butter. Once melted, add the diced onions and minced garlic. Sauté for two to three minutes.</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper the chicken thighs liberally on both sides.</li>
    <li>Gently push the sautéed onions and garlic to the sides of the pan. Then place the chicken thighs in the skillet in a single layer. Brown the chicken for 1-2 minutes per side, just until color forms. Move the chicken to a holding plate and set aside.</li>
    <li>Mix together the rice, lemon zest, rosemary, and bouillon in the skillet. Stir well, and place the chicken pieces on top of the rice. Pour in the water and give a gentle stir around the chicken.</li>
    <li>Bring the dish to just barely a boil. Cover the skillet, reduce heat, and simmer for fifteen to twenty minutes, until the rice is cooked through. The water should be completely absorbed and there should be vent holes in the top of the rice when it is done.</li>
    <li>Lastly, remove the lid and move the chicken pieces to the side of the pan or to a plate. Stir in ¼ cup lemon juice, the Parmesan cheese, and parsley into the rice. Taste and season as needed.</li>
</ol>
